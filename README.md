##### Summary
The purpose of this analysis is to get a summary of two months on opposite spectrums of year to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year round business. According to the summary statistics the mean for June is 74 F and December is 71 F. The standard deviation for both of these months is 3, meaning the variance is low. From this data, you can speculate that the over all temperature of O'ahu is realatively similar year round. 
Two additonal queries that should be preformed one being a summary of precipitation the previous years, and summary of the water temperature. Summary of the precipitation would determine which time of the year recieves the most rainfall. Additonaly, the second query would be to anaylsis the temperature of the water year round. This anaylsis would be optimal to determine how many months out of the year would people likely be want to surf.
